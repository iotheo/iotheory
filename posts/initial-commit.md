Recently, I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree ~~even though it should've been obtained a long ago~~ and I'm quite impressed about it.

No matter what, everyone should be proud of their achievements, regardless of what happened in the process or how long did it take.

So, let's get straight to the context of this post. Now that I'm able to look back and observe things in a more "sober" and objective perspective, let me highlight a few things.

* People should worry about your health; not your progress.
Let's not turn a blind eye to this. There is a peer pressure about ending everything in time, but hey, everyone is different. Every individual needs different timespans, and there are several variables that may have an impact on it.
People act like it's the end of the world, if one doesn't graduate, and the funny thing is, they do not even get affected by it, nor should they apply more pressure to you than already is, to begin with.

* Be grateful to the ones that supported you through all this.
We sometimes forget to thank our closest people who have given us all they had, in order to make us happy.
As an introvert myself, I always find the best of excuses to avoid such occasions but, it's about time to get through this.<br>
It's my duty to publicly thank my family; my grandparents who are suddenly not with us anymore; my girlfriend;  and my friends for all this, and I am glad you were always there for me.

* Your degree is not what defines you professionally.
I love the tech industry and by no means I'm implicitly saying I'm going to shift anytime soon, but the majority of people -in Greece- have a tendency to think of their degree and/or job as their one and only option until retirement.
There's nothing wrong about career shifting at all. There are people that are getting bored by their jobs/hobbies -including myself-.
Maybe the reason I chose computer science over something else is because of its rapid evolution, hence no chances of stagnancy.
